\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the difference between point and region predictors?

\item When does a region predictor make an error?

\item What is meant by accuracy and efficiency of a region predictor?
  What are the trivial ways to achieve 100\% accuracy or 100\%
  efficiency?

\item What is the relation between confidence and significance?
  
\item What is validity of a predictor on the confidence level
  $\delta$?

\item What is a non-conformity measure?

\item Describe the non-conformity measure based on shortest distances
  to the objects with the same and different labels. Will the
  p-values change if we replace distances by their squares?

\item Give an example of a non-conformity measure based on a
  regression algorithm.

\item How are p-values calculated from non-conformity scores?

\item How does one make TCP point predictions with confidence and
  credibility from p-values?

\item How does one make TCP region predictions from p-values?

\item Describe the randomised (smoothed) TCP region predictor. state
  its validity property. What kind of validity does it imply for the
  TCP region predictor? Explain.

\item Formulate the optimality property of TCP region predictors.

\item What are the exchangeable distributions? Are i.i.d.\ random
  variables exchangeable?

\item What are inductive confidence predictors? What is their main
  advantage over transductive confidence predictors?

\item Formulate the validity property if inductive confidence
  predictors.

\item Explain why unbalanced datasets may present a problem for
  transductive confidence predictors.

\item What is a Mondrian taxonomy? Describe the Mondrian predictor and
  its randomised version.

\item What validity property does the Mondrian predictor have?

\item Consider the problem of recognising handwritten digits with the
  possible labels $0,1,2,\ldots,9$. Suppose the following p-values (in
  percent) have been calculated:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 0 & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4   & 5  & 6  & 7 & 8  & 9 \\
\hline
 2 & 10 & 21 & 12 &  70 & 15 & 45 & 1 & 32 & 5 \\
\hline  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make a TCP point prediction and calculate its confidence and
  credibility.

  {\em Answer:} 4, credibility 70\%, confidence 55\%.

\item Make a TCP region predictions with the confidence levels of 95\%
  and 70\%.

  {\em Answer:} $\Gamma^{0.05} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8\}$

  $\Gamma^{0.3} = \{4, 6, 8\}$
  
\end{itemize}
  
\item Consider the following training set:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  example & label\\
  \hline
  $(2,1)$ & X\\
  $(0,1)$ & X\\
  $(-1,1)$ & X\\
  $(0,-1)$ & O\\
  $(1,0)$ & O\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Make TCP point and region predictions and Mondrian predictions for the
test example $(1,1)$ using the non-conformity measure

$$A(\Lbag (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),\ldots, (x_{n},y_{n})\Rbag
,(x,y)) = \frac{\min_{j: y_j = y} d(x_j,x)}{\min_{j: y_j \ne
y}d(x_j,x)}$$

and confidence levels of $95\%$, $70\%$ and $60\%$.

{\em Answer:} Point prediction: O with confidence $0.6667$ and
credibility $0.5$.

TCP region predictions: $\Gamma^{0.05}=\{X,O\}$;  $\Gamma^{0.3}=\{X,O\}$;
$\Gamma^{0.4}=\{O\}$.

Mondrian predictions: $\Gamma^{0.05}=\{X,O\}$;  $\Gamma^{0.3}=\{O\}$;
$\Gamma^{0.4}=\varnothing$.
